title: Introducing Hyde
---

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

### Built on Poole

Text here:

* Just text
* Links (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

```javascript
  function hello() {

  }
```

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
